This project presents a Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is widely recognized as a secure accesscontrol mechanism for data sharing. However, the generation of secret keys (SK) in most CP-ABE schemes relies on a
centralized authority (CA), which can result in high costs for establishing trust and pose a single point of failure. To address these challenges and leverage the characteristics of blockchain technology, several blockchain-based schemes have been
proposed to prevent data disclosure and protect user privacy attributes. In this project, we propose IAM-BDSS, a novel CP-ABE identity-attribute management data sharing scheme based on blockchain, aimed at ensuring privacy through hidden policies and
attributes. Additionally, we introduce a transaction structure to ensure the traceability of parameter transmission within the blockchain system. Through experimental results and security analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of IAMBDSS.
